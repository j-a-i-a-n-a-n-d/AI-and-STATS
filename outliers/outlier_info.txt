Outliers is the data point in dataset different from all other data in dataset.
Example : a person scoring 8 runs in 1 ball.

Leads to incorrect mean and SD.
Thereby we need to remove the outliers.
Here we are using the method IQR(interquartile range)



the IQR method comprises of the 4 percentiles 

Q1 = 25%ile 
Q2 = 50%ile
Q3 = 75%ile 
1.) Calculate the Q1 and Q3 Quartile.

2.) Find the quartile range    :     IQR=q3-q1

3.) Find lower bound           : Lower Bound = q1-1.5iqr

4.) Find the upper bound      :Upper Bound = q3+ 1.5iqr

5.) Anything that lies below the lower bound and the upper bound is a outlier.



Ques 1 : 
1.) Build a Linear Regression Model for the csv MBA.csv.
2.) Predict salary for 74.66.

Ques 2 : 
1.) Build multi-linear model for the data set cars.csv.
2.) Predict CO2 based on volume and height.
3.) Predict coefficient and intercept values.
4.) Predict CO2 for the Volume =1650 and Weight=1310.
