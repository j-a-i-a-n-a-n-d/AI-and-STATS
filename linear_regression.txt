y=mx+b
formula for linear regression
y = dependent var
x= independent var
m=coefficient 
b= intercept

we need to find the values of b and m(slope)

Types of linear relationship
1.) Positive linear relationship :-
val of x increases with the val of y 
                                     slope < 1
2.) Negative linear relationship :-
val of one var increases with the decreases with the val of other
                                     slope >1
